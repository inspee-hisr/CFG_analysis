## Administrative data of Greece

We downloaded the greek municipality boundaries (Kallikratis plan) from [http://geodata.gov.gr/en/dataset/oria-demon-kallikrates](http://geodata.gov.gr) in the epsg 4326 format. In this format the axis order is Latitude followed by Longitude. 
The Greek names of municipalities were converted using the ISO 843 traslitaration system from this [online portal](http://www.passport.gov.gr/elot-743.html).
