title: Spatial Analysis
aside: false

In this analysis we used spatial data (e.g shapefiles) to enrich the cave fauna of Greece. We incorporated the shapefiles as detailed below:

* Greece administrative data [geodata.gov.gr](http://geodata.gov.gr/en/dataset?tags=administrative+units)
* [Natura 2000 areas](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/access_data/index_en.htm)
* [Wildlife refugees](https://geodata.gov.gr/dataset/kataphugia-agrias-zoes-e-per-gr)

We used these packages for the analysis in R:

* [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html)
* [rgdal](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rgdal/versions/1.4-4)
* [maptools](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/maptools/versions/0.9-5)
